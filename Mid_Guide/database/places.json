  "history": "In February-March 1818, Bhopal became a princely state in\n       British India as a result of the Anglo-Bhopal treaty between the East India Company and Nawab Nazar Muhammad (Nawab of Bhopal \n        during 1816-1819). Bhopal state included the present-day Bhopal, Raisen, and Sehore districts, and was part of the Central India \n        Agency. It straddled the Vindhya Range, with the northern portion lying on the Malwa plateau, and the southern portion lying in \n        the valley of the Narmada River, which formed the stateâ€™s southern boundary. Bhopal Agency was formed as an administrative \n        section of Central India, consisting the Bhopal state and some princely states to the northeast, including Khilchipur, \n        Narsingarh, Raigarh, and after 1931 the Dewas states. It was administered by an agent to the British Governor-General of India.",

It is a fine example of Mughal architecture, comparable to the iconic Jama Masjid in Delhi. It boasts a broad pink faÃ§ade, spacious courtyards, smooth marble flooring and an inter-arched roof. The minarets rise to a height of 67 m. The mosque has 27 interlinked ceilings, 16 of which are adorned with petal motifs. Every year, a three-day congregation used to be organised at Taj-Ul-Masjid, but it has since moved to Islam Nagar because its popularity grew so much that even the large mosque proved too small for hosting the event.\nThe masjid's construction was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum (1868-1901). His daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, continued its construction throughout her lifetime. After remaining in a dormant state for decades, its construction began once again in 1971 and ended in 1985.\n",
